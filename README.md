# Orbit Simulation

This project focuses on building a platform to be expandable to contain many factors. So far, developer have been testing gravitation force and aerodynamics forces, drag and lifting force. 

## Future Plan

1. improve visualization platform (draw the Earth) --finished(have introduced in earth)

2. improve the process of drawing

2. introduce function of thrusting

3. design a controller to control the spacecraft to reentry atmosphere

4. improve controller to use optimization theory

5. introduce moon into theory and contian tidal force

6. turn it into three-dimension simulation

7. improve visualization process
